# The dreaded 404 Error Page!
### This is a [DevChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/) project.

**404 Not Found** is a beginner level challenge that involves following a wireframe provided on Figma, and creating a simple static error page. It also involves creating a responsive mobile version of the same page.

The steps taken were the following:
- Download the challenge files
- Open Figma and study the wireframe
- Set up the HTML skeleton
- Define the CSS rules according to the Figma wireframe
- Test the website
- Push the code to GitHub
- Deploy the website with Netlify.
